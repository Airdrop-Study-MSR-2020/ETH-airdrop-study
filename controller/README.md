#Explanation
This program is to find the controller in the airdrop. Controller is a kind of airdrop user that controlled more than one account to attend the airdrop.
We also get the amount of tokens that the controller get from the controlled account

#Usage
```
python get_controller.py airdrops.csv controller_count.csv controlled_account.csv
```

$airdrops.csv$ is the file that contains all of the airdrop we found before. The scheme is as follow:

$controller_count.csv$ contains the controller and the number of accounts that it controls

$controlled_account.csv$ contains the controlled account
